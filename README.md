# Matrix_Calculator_v
# Made by MaterialI. 
Performs basic operations on matricies such as: addition(+), substraction(-), multiplication(*), scaling, RREF, and Inverse operations. (more features to be added);)
Doesn't support vectorized operations, thus a bit slower for hugeamount of data. 
However, will perfectly do for homeworks, assignments, etc.
